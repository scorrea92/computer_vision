## 1 Gender Recognition

Images from "Labeled Faces in the Wild" dataset (LFW) in realistic scenarios, poses and gestures. Faces are automatically detected and cropped to 100x100 pixels RGB.

![image](scripts/face.png)

**Training** set: 10585 images
**Test** set: 2648 images 

**Python code**: [here](scripts/gender.py)

**Goals:**
* Implement a model with >95% accuracy over test set
* Implement a model with >90% accuracy with less than 100K parameters

Images of 20 different models of cars.

![image](jupyter/bilinear/cars.png)

**Goals:**
* Load a pre-trained VGG16
* Connect this pre-trained model and form a bi-linear
* Train freezing weights or not
* Understand the above Keras implementations:
  * Name the layers
  * Built several models
  * Understand tensors sizes
  * Connect models with operations (outproduct)
  * Create an image generator that returns a list of tensors
  * Create a data flow with multiple inputs for the model
  * Understand the limitations of the proposed solution
